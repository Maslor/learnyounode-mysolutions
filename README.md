# learnyounode-mysolutions
:neckbeard: What I ended up with while doing the 13 learnyounode challenges

These are my solutions (not the official ones, the ones I wrote when completing the challenges) for the learnyounode challenges. 

*Still Ongoing - 8/13 challenges completed*

Original workshops on https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode

####### Bear in mind that I am also at begginer level in terms of node.js , these are probably not the most efficient solutions
